# DNAshapedTFBS_notebooks

This directory contains the data and IPython notebooks used to generate the figures in our
manuscript *DNA shape features improve transcription factor binding site predictions* in vivo
(Mathelier *et al.*, 2016, under review).

## Notebooks

- E2F_combined.ipynb: Used to generate plots for Figures 5A and S5A.
- EncodeDinucMatched1st2ndDnashapeDimo.ipynb: Used to generate plots for
Figures in Data Set S3.
- EncodeGCmatched1st2ndDNAshapeDimo.ipynb: Used to generate plots for Figures
2, 4, and S1, and Figures in Data Sets S2 and S6. Used to generate Table S2 in
Data Set S1.
- EncodeReccurentPeaksGCmatched1st2ndDNAshapeDimo.ipynb: Used to generate plots
for Figures in Data Set S4.
- EncodeGCmatched1st2ndDNAshapeDimoMethodsComparisons.ipynb: Used to generate
plots for Figure 3 and Figures in Data Set S5.
- MADS_combined.ipynb: Used to generate plots for Figures 5B, 7A and S5B.
- PlantsGCmatched1st2ndDNAshapeDimo.ipynb: Used to generate plots for Figure
S2.

## Launching the notebooks

We recommend to use binder to launch the multiple IPython notebooks:
